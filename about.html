            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>MindMirror is designed to be a simple and intuitive tool for emotional reflection.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Reflect on Feelings:</strong> Use the mood slider on the Home page to select how you're feeling. The visual "mood mirror" will change to reflect your selection.</li>
                <li><strong>Add Context:</strong> You can optionally add a note to provide more context to your mood entry. This helps in understanding patterns over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Mindful Anchor:</strong> If you log a particularly challenging mood, MindMirror may offer a brief, guided grounding exercise to help you recenter.</li>
                <li><strong>No Login Required:</strong> Your privacy is paramount. MindMirror does not require any account creation or login.</li>
                <li><strong>Local Data Storage:</strong> All your mood entries are stored directly in your browser's localStorage. This means your data stays on your device and is not sent to any server.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve Mental Clarity:</strong> By regularly tracking your mood and engaging in moments of reflection, you can gain insights into your emotional patterns, triggers, and overall well-being, fostering mental clarity and mindfulness.</li>
            </ul>
