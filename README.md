How It Works
MindMirror is designed to be a simple and intuitive tool for emotional reflection.

Reflect on Feelings: Use the mood slider on the Home page to select how you're feeling. The visual "mood mirror" will change to reflect your selection.
Add Context: You can optionally add a note to provide more context to your mood entry. This helps in understanding patterns over time.
Mindful Anchor: If you log a particularly challenging mood, MindMirror may offer a brief, guided grounding exercise to help you recenter.
No Login Required: Your privacy is paramount. MindMirror does not require any account creation or login.
Local Data Storage: All your mood entries are stored directly in your browser's localStorage. This means your data stays on your device and is not sent to any server.
Improve Mental Clarity: By regularly tracking your mood and engaging in moments of reflection, you can gain insights into your emotional patterns, triggers, and overall well-being, fostering mental clarity and mindfulness.
Our Goal
We aim to provide a private, accessible, and easy-to-use tool to help you connect with your emotions and promote self-awareness and gentle self-care.
